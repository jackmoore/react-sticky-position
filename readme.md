# Deprecated

I feel like browser support for `position:sticky` is now good enough that I no longer plan to polyfill the feature my projects.  Feel free to use this, just know that I don't plan on reaching full compatibility with `position:sticky`.

## Summary

React component that implements `position: sticky` behavior.  Uses the [sticky-position](https://github.com/jackmoore/sticky-position) polyfill.
